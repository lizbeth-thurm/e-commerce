  ## Usage

  This app manages the backend for an e-commerce site.  Users are able to get information on available products, delete them, add them, and update them.  Currently, this backend may be analyzed through an app such as insomnia to test the end points for the various apis.

  There are routes for products in general, cateegories of products, and product tags.

  Run ```npm run seed``` to seed code and ```npm run start``` to connect to the server.
